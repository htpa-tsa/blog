### What is Python?

Python is a high-level programming language that is used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. As a beginner-friendly language, it has become the second most popular programming language among developers. An example of Python would be in interactive games whenever the user interacts with the game. Another example would be customizing visualization for data so that it is appealing and efficient.

### Getting Started

To get started with Python you will find various resources online since it is a common language that is as well known as JavaScript. You will also need something to motivate you in order to learn it. If you want to get started on Visual Studio Code, follow these steps and you can become proficient in Python.

### Starting on Visual Studio Code

- For Windows, you also may need the Python3 executable itself, available from their [official page](https://www.python.org/downloads/). For Macs, once you have the VSCode extension installed you will need to download [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a package manager, and download `python3` from there:

```bash
brew install python3
```

- Once you have done this, there might be some other things to install, and the terminal will show you what exactly you need to install as well as give you the commands to enter in order to install them.

- If you would like a debugger, you may download the  **Python C++ Debugger**:
